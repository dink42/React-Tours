# React Project
+ This is a React project that I created for learning and reusing the code. It uses TypeScript and custom components. I followed a tutorial but changed a lot of things to my liking.

+ ## How to use this project, here is how to start ***fresh***!. <em>This will not make my project!</em>
+ You can either look at the code to see what it does, or download it and run it locally. You can also use it as a template or a reference for your own React projects.

+ ## How to start a fresh React project
+ Go to their official site to read their documentation for more instructions, https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

+ Make sure you have Node.js installed and know at least basic JavaScript.
+ Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. For example, <code>cd Desktop</code>.
+ Run <code>npx create-react-app my-app</code> to create a boilerplate React app. You can name your app whatever you want instead of my-app.
+ Navigate to the app directory by running cd my-app.
+ Run <code>npm start</code> to start your app in localhost. Go to http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
+ You can also use <code>npm init react-app my-app</code> instead of <code>npx create-react-app my-app</code>, but npx is recommended. For more details, check out the official documentation.

+ ## Contact me
+ Feel free to send me a message if you want to collaborate on something or have any questions. I am happy to help with what I know and learn from others. I am not an expert, but I have some experience in most languages.

+ **Functions** of React-Tours in short terms, Delete Tour page blocks and add nice tour blocks, with picture and placeholder text. It's made to be easy to expand on, loading while the site relodes. Nice layout to the pages and responsive design. Check the code too see wich functions i mainly use.
